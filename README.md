What is this?
=============

This attaches to a ps2controller, and provides two other devices (which
need their own driver):

* ApplePS2KeyboardDevice
* ApplePS2MouseDevice

This version is Apple's own code, modified to build correctly on modern
64-bit operating systems, and corresponding compilers.
